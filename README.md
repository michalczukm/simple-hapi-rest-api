# Simple hapi.js API
This repository contains simple RESTfull API written in ES6 on node.js with [hapi.js](https://hapijs.com/) framework.

I am using it during my HTTP and RESTfull APIs classes, probably you're here because of that :smile: Feel free to use it and play with as you'd like :steam_locomotive:

## How to run the project
:warning: Precondition: You have installed 
* `nodejs` >= 8.x
* `npm` >= 5.x or `yarn` >= 1.3.x

1. Install dependencies: run `npm install` or `yarn install`
1. Run `npm start`
1. Server should be available under `localhost:5050` by default.

## End-points
All endpoints are documented in [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), lunch your server and visit http://localhost:5050/api/documentation

## I wan't to fast run API with my own data!
No problem, try [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), npm package which will setup you local fake REST API within a minute without any code (rly :panda_face:).
